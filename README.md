NaNoWriMo project for @gaeajen-6L27

This is an adult (NSFW) story in which Nina, an otter-woman, confronts some of the biases she was raised with, and engages with **consensual** mind control to change herself and explore sexuality.

Invited contributors are welcome as pre-readers, proof-readers, editors, and commentators to the writing process. Invited contributors may also propose characters to make cameos within the story, or to suggest side plots (though such suggestions do not guarantee the use of such ideas or characters) and to suggest ways to flesh out characters already within the story.

To make a contribution as a reader, use `comment/` or make sure your commit log includes `PROOF` to start the commit notes.

To make suggestions or requests, please use `suggestion/` for any requested content.

## Formatting

The story in this profile uses Markdown formatting with plain text. The following conventions are used:

- \*foo\* represents *emphasis* or *italic* text.
- \*\*bar\*\* represents **strong** or **bold** text.
- \_baz\_ represents <sub>subscript text</sub> (though Markdown will treat it as emphasis or italics)
- \_\_bash\_\_ represents <u>underlined text</u> (though Markdown will treat it as strong or bold)
- \=fizz\= represents small-caps text (Markdown will not render this in any special manner)
- \=\=bang\=\= represents forced-caps text (Markdown will not render this in any special manner)

As a matter of preference, if multiple of these formts are used for the same span of text, asterisks should be in the outer layer, underscores in the middle, and equal signs closest to the text.

Markdown linting will recognize the use of mixed asterisks and underscores as an inconsistency: If you use a markdown linter, please disregard any linting warnings related to this.
