It was late January, a heavily overcast day in Alabaster. Nina was learning so much about some of the professional tools, and how to work in a team setting. Today, though, she was fetching coffee for the team. She had orders for everybody except Orville, who was making his own blend.

“Hey there,” came a familiar voice, startling Nina as she got close to the Moondoes near the office. She turned to look and recognized Agi, walking up at a light jog from behind her. “How are you holding up?”

“I’m fine,” Nina said, stopping for a moment. “I’m enjoying the project. It’s weird, though. They all seem to be so… different from me.”

Agi smiled and opened the door to the coffee shop. “Everybody is different and unique,” she said. “Is there a problem with that?”

Nina shook her head, not wanting to upset the raccoon. “I guess not, but… I never thought I’d like people who were so different from me.” She bit on her lower lip and walked into the coffee shop. “I’ve been meaning to ask, why don’t I see you around campus?”

“I’m not from Alabaster,” Agi said. “I finished an online program already, but can’t get my degree issued until I finish an internship. I… well, my sister and cousin love Flowers, so I had reasons to choose Redwood.”

Nina chuckled a bit at that. “It’s fine to like Flowers, isn’t it? It’s one of the all-time top games on phones.” The cashier waved her over, and she started to order, making sure each drink got the right name to it. After adding her own special order she turned to Agi. “I’m sure the company won’t mind if I pay for yours too?”

“Oh, well, I just want a Honey Apple Spice,” Agi said. “I can get my own, I’m not on the clock or anything.”

“Don’t be so proud,” Nina said. “You’re part of the team too. Come on up and order already.”

Agi seemed embarrassed, but did come up and put her order on the company order. She moved to the side with Nina and looked around. “Honestly, I’ve wanted to talk to you for a while,” she said. “I’m kind of lonely up here. I’m living up by Lake Earl, with my aunties and cousins, but it means I don’t know my way around the city. I’d really like to get out more than just for evening review meetings once a week or walking around the mall with my cousin.”

“Oh, well, I guess we could hang out on Saturday,” Nina said, raising her chin as she thought about having a friend. She hadn’t made many friends in school who she did anything with outside of school. Being in the program she was, she’d found a lot of neck-maned boys, and most of the girls were a bit too far out of her comfort zone for any casual hanging out. “Maybe meet at the mall around noon?”

“That sounds nice,” Agi said. “And if you know of any nightclubs, I’d love to know where they are.”
