The rest of the week went quickly, though Nina did notice that Amanda almost seemed to be too interested in her work, rather than her own. Of course, Amanda seemed to be ahead of schedule on her backgrounds, while Nina was just doing stress-tests for the Live2D models. They had a program that let them use a webcam to make the models move based on a real person, and she had to make sure none of the poses or expressions were overtuned.

When Lar mentioned the weekly after-hours meeting, Nina shook her head. “Next week, I promise. I’ve just got a… I feel drained, you know?”

Lar was understanding. On the way home, Nina stopped at a gyro shop, getting a very loaded wrap with a cup of chipotle tzatiki for dipping, a generously “small” bag of shoelace style fries and, just to be healthy, a two-liter bottle of Mexican pineapple soda.

She wasn’t looking forward to going out tomorrow. Not that she didn’t _want_ a friend, but she’d rarely had friends outside of church. She didn’t know how safe people were outside of church, but…

She’d been in classes with gay and lesbian students for years now. Most of them were good enough people, none of them had tried to make her do anything she felt was wrong. Even if a few had flirted with her, they’d stopped when she told them she wasn’t interested.

But it still made her uncomfortable sometimes. They said things she didn’t understand, and since starting at college, she had noticed that even a lot of the straight students were being more lewd than they’d seemed to be in high school. They were living in sin, and Nina didn’t want to take part in that lifestyle. At least you don’t need to talk about it all in public, she thought.

Of course, that was only part of the problem. She wanted a boyfriend, but none of the boys at church were right for her, she’d known all of them since nursery school. She didn’t really know how to find out which of the boys at school would be safe, or who would start bragging if he got a kiss.

Then there was the fact that Nina had been struggling with sinful thoughts about girls for years. She still remembered the time she’d seen Shelly Cooper after she’d lost her bikini top, and just wanted to… to squeeze them. She knew that she shouldn’t have those thoughts if she was a good Catholic, and she _had_ confessed the sinful desires to the priest.

Still, the thoughts came. There was no good way to stop them, and… Amanda had stirred more of them. “I won’t touch myself while thinking about her breasts,” Nina muttered as she locked the front door of her house. She set her food on the coffee table in the living room, then ran to her bedroom. She had some prayers to say to still her sinful thoughts.
