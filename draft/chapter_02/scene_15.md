Nina took her earbuds out and stuffed them into the pocket of her purse. She checked her watch and sighed. 1145. She was waiting near the front entrance that faced toward the beach. It was a sunny day, good for walking around. Nina had dressed casually, in a lightweight black hoodie and tights with a long blue skirt. Her hoodie was pulled up, and she was swiping through her phone, not quite paying full attention to the world around her.

So she was surprised to feel a tap on her shoulder. The voice wasn’t who she expected either.

“You’d make an adorable goth,” came a voice to her right. By the time Nina had turned, there was nobody, but turning to the left, she saw Trixie sitting there. “The cute and adorable Trixie can tell.”

“I’m not a goth, though,” Nina said. She looked over the sweatshirt and short skirt Trixie was wearing. “I just… like this hoodie.”

“And it looks very cute,” Trixie said. “But you should try the look sometime. Maybe you’ll like how you look in black and fishnets and leather boots. You should add me on Eegle, I’d love to help you if you ever want a makeover.”

Nina blushed a bit, but exchanged Eegle contact information with Trixie. “I look fine, don’t I?”

Trixie smiled and nodded. “Of course you do. But there’s nothing wrong with trying new things out, is there?”

“I guess not,” Nina said, looking to her watch again. “I’m meeting Agi to show her around the city. If you aren’t busy, would you care to join us?”

“Trixie has an appointment at the salon in a little bit,” Trixie said with a warm smile. “But I would love to meet up with you after I’ve finished getting my coat groomed. I’ll message you on Eegle.”

“Thanks.” Nina smiled then looked at her watch. “I don’t want to hold you up, and Agi should be here soon.”

“Take care of yourself, girl,” Trixie said, standing up. “Is it okay if I hug you before I go?”

Nina froze for a second. “I, sorry… I just, not a huge fan of hugs. Fist bump, maybe?”

“Sure,” Trixie said, holding out her right hand. As Nina gave her fist a gentle bump, she fluttered out her fingers. “Ba-la-la-la-la. See you around, Nina.”

Nina turned to watch Trixie head into the mall, smiling a bit. Sure, she was a bit childish, but she was kind. She was a good person.

There was a squeal of brakes as a black car with lavender racing stripes pulled up to the curb. The window rolled down, and Agi looked out wearing sunglasses. “So you wanna hop in, or give me a walking tour, girlfriend?”
