# Tuesday: 12 January

Nina had the morning off due to her class schedule, so she spent it working on some sketches in her character notebook. She had designed a magical girl team that included a fox, badger, and goat before she realized she was just dwelling on her co-workers be recognizing the fur pattern on her badger was the same as what she could see on Amanda.

She had packed up her laptop around 11, and headed to the Summer Heat. They had a vegan burrito that was amazing, with beans and spinach and lots of onions and mushrooms. She decided to try their Cinnamon Latte, too, and after ordering, she found a quiet table in the corner to enjoy her lunch.

She started to work on her class notes while she ate. Freelance contracts would be a pain of a class, but if she didn’t land a proper job she knew she would need it. She was halfway through reviewing the draft contract when she heard someone approaching her table. She looked up and saw Amanda, wearing tights and a sports bra, with a messenger bag slung over her left shoulder.

“Hey Nina,” Amanda said, smiling cheerfully. “Mind if I join you? I’m on my lunch break.”

Nina nodded and swallowed. Moving her hands to her lap, she clasped them together and thought a prayer to herself, then nodded. “Y-yeah, I, um… I’d be… happy to have the company?” She felt awkward and uncertain. She did want the company, but something _wrong_ was stirring too.

“Thanks,” Amanda said, setting down a metal tumbler and a bagel sandwich. “So what are you working on?” As she sat down, Nina became far more aware of the size of Amanda’s breasts. She’d always been wearing loose shirts in the office, but there was nothing hiding their size now.

“Just coursework,” Nina said, swallowing and closing her eyes. She repeated the prayer from before, to ignore temptations. “So do you run much?”

“I love running,” Amanda said. Nina coudl swear that her breasts were hanging over the edge of the table. “How do you stay fit?”

“I, uh, Pilates,” Nina said. “And swimming. I was on my high school swim team.” It wasn’t lying to not mention that her mama had made her join the swim team, or that she’d never really been one of the best members. By thinking about that, though, she found herself curious about how Amanda would look in a swimsuit.

Amanda nodded and raised her sandwich to her mouth. “I was track champ after daddy forced me to go out for the girls track team,” she said. “Of course, that was before my breasts got so big. I can’t run as fast or as long now.”

Nina blushed and nodded. “I guess. I’m just going over some of my business course, we started the semester with how to be a freelancer.”

Lunch had gone well once the topic was off Amanda’s body, and Nina headed into the office with Nina, who ducked into one of the ground floor bathrooms in the lobby, no doubt to change into something more like what Nina had seen the other times she’d been in.

Emma was working on the characters in a 2D animation package. Nina understood that a small team wouldn’t have as much room to work in 3D, but the software Emma was using seemed almost like magic, able to make a 2D character move and look like they were 3D. “How does it do that so easily?”

“Well, it’s not easy,” Emma said. “I actually have a lot of practice on this stack, it’s called Live2D, and it probably isn’t something your school teaches. There’s a ton of complicated math to make it look decent, and several tons more to make it look great, but… once you get the hang of it, it’s actually a lot of fun. I could show you how?”
