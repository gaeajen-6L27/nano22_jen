# Monday: 11 January

Nina had woken up early and gotten a _pain au chocolat_ with an Extra Peppermint Latte at the Summer Heat on her way in to school. She had three hours of back-to-back-to-back classes, all mandatory classes she’d been putting off. Still, the academic side wasn’t too bad. Dull more than anything.

It was at work that she had been challenged. There had been another intern there when she arrived, a rather uncomfortable-looking raccoon. Lar had made them do a proper introduction before the other intern could leave, a normal sort of thing, going around the room to introduce themselves, mention something they considered important about themselves, one thing they liked, and one thing they hated.

Of course, nobody had seemed eager to start this sort of kiddy introduction game. Eventually, Lar pointed at Amanda. “Amanda, you’re up first. Since nobody else wants to start, I’ll be picking names.”

“Fine, I’m Amanda Andrews and I am an _artiste_ who loves environmental work. I like surfing and hiking on the weekends, and I dislike stuffy clothes.” Amanda punctuated the last remark by tugging on the collar of her shirt.

Lar nodded, then looked around the group. “Fine, so I’m Larry Logan, but you can all call me Lar since we’re on a team. I been with the company for 8 years, since just after the Lost Legend thing, and I like making sure things work smoothly. I might look grumpy or gruff, but my goal is making sure all of you are comfortable and happy, kay? I like pampering myself with spa visits, and I dislike mushrooms. Next up, Omar.”

Nina tried to imagine the pig at a spa, and almost laughed, but why shouldn’t a guy like that? His job must be stressful.

“Hey, I’m Orville Omar,” the tabby said. He seemed grumpy, but after a few seconds he rolled his eyes and continued. “I make the best coffee in this office, I like to drink coffee, and I dislike chocolate. No, I’m not allergic, I just dislike it, so don’t offer me anything with chocolate or cocoa.”

Nina remembered how he’d responded to Rhys the other day. Maybe he was due for another coffee?

“Gavin Graham,” said the alligator, before Lar could call out a name. “I’m your friendly type, and when I’m not in the office I might be on the roof for a puff and sun. I like to watch people, and I hate yelling.”

Nina refused to ask if “puff” just meant cigarettes or weed, but she looked around and stood up. She might as well do this.

“So, I’m Nina Nuñez, the intern. I’m a cosplayer and like going to to San Diego for Comic Con, which I haven’t missed since 2015. I dislike leafy vegetables.”

There was a small round of applause for her.

“Emma Estrada,” game the voice of the fox-girl. “I’m an unapologetic lesbian, I like body positivity, and I dislike Disney designs.” After solid beat, she added, “I mean, in general their movie designs are so LCD and bland, some of their TV shows do interesting things.”

Emma was a lesbian? She seemed friendly, but did Nina need to watch herself around the fox-girl?

“You, uh, you can call me Agi,” the racoon said. “Agi Zabat, I mean. I’m a major collector of animation and game memorabilia. I like watching extreme sports and I hate when people assume I hate everything because I dress like a goth.”

Nina hadn’t even noticed that Agi was dressed that way. Maybe she should hang out with the raccoon girl sometime? Though she was also curious why she’d never seen Agi around before if they were both in the gaming degree program.

The introductions continued. Rhys was a connoisseur of coffee, liked vintage game machines, and disliked seafood. Trixie introduced herself as being transgender. She liked hypnosis — “like stage shows,” she explained — and disliked “my childhood idol.” There were a few other team members Nina hadn’t met, but she couldn’t keep all of them straight right now. She was fine remembering their names at work, but they didn’t seem as interesting as the one Nina had already met.

After Agi had said her goodbyes for the day, Lar took Nina aside and asked her what part of the team she wanted to work with, and then she’d been handed off to work with Emma, the character designer.
