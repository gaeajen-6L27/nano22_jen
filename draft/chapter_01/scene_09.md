# Thursday: 14 January

Nina was pretty sure that Amanda was casually flirting with Emma and Trixie. Probably herself, maybe also Agi (though most of the time, Agi was out before Nina arrived). It wasn’t wrong to be flirted with, was it?

Emma started teaching her how to use Cubism to defined how characters would animate. By the end of the day, Nina had made her character, which she called Princesa, to make an almost convincing smirk. In a straight-front view. She’d been going for a smile, but Emma was encouraging her.
