Nina had taken Emma up on the offer, and was in the process of coloring on of her original character designs for most of her shift. Emma regularly looked over and checked on her layer structure, the hardest part of this stack was keeping all the layers properly separated, instead of just working in the broad layers Nina was used to handling. She couldn’t really collapse the layers either, like she’d done back when she started to learn about digital inking.

By the end of the day, Emma said they could try setting the character up in a program called Cubism tomorrow. As they were heading out, Amanda had gotten a little too close to Nina in the elevator. Nina had kind of enjoyed the squishy breasts, though she knew she should never admit to it.
