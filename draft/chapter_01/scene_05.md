# Chapter 1

The first week of school had been rough. Nina let out a heavy sigh as she flopped onto her bed, burying her face in her pillow. Classes were fine, but every day she was spending 4 hours in the afternoon at the Redwood office, and learning the ropes of working in their team. They apparently had another intern, but she was working the morning shift. Nina just needed a few minutes before she sorted out dinner.

“Just breathe,” she told herself, closing her eyes. “It’s just a new routine. You just need to get used to it.”

A few minutes passed as she cleared her head and she started to hum. It was some song that had been playing in the office, she didn’t really know the words or anything. But it helped to have any sort of music.

When she got up, she realized it had been almost a half-hour since she’d gotten home. It was time to sort out dinner, and review the week.
