The building had three upstairs floors, and each was home to a different game team. The ground floor was common areas, like the café and arcade and even a handful of quiet-time rooms with whiteboards and a lot of dry erase markers in different colors, along with beanbags or hammocks or fluffy sofas. “Sometimes you just need a break to think, process, create something… You can always come down for the quiet-time rooms when you need them,” Amanda explained. “Of course, you probably won’t be working quite as hard as the rest of us, but that still doesn’t mean being an intern here is like recess.”

“I understand,” Nina said, looking around. “I’m happy to work, I don’t need much time for myself.”

Amanda shrugged. “Let’s head upstairs, then.”

As they got off the elevator at 3F, Amanda raised her hand in a big wave. “Hey everybody! Where’s Lar?”

Nina covered her ears at the loud voice so close to her, but looked out over the area. Everybody seemed to have a workspace set aside for them, but most of them were hanging out in the middle of the office, drawing or talking. A hyena with numerous studded piercings on their body turned to Amanda first. “Lar’s out for a lunch meeting with Nessa. Progress report.”

“Aww, well, I found our new intern down in the lobby. I thought I could show her around.” Amanda gently led Nina to the center of the floor. There were tables lined with comics and manga, they all seemed to be on pretty different topics. One table had a board game going on, another had a coffee carafe and packed snacks. The hyena was by a whiteboard with a drawing of what looked like a game interface.

“Rhys, this is Nina. Nina, Rhys Rogers. Rhys is a coffee fiend, and hates decaf.”

“I’m a connoisseur,” Rhys said, rolling their eyes. “And there’s literally no point to a coffee without caffeine. We didn’t start drinking this stuff because of the smell or taste, we acquired the taste because of the drug.”

By now, a few of the others had turned look at the new face. A tough-as-nails looking tabby held up a fist towards Rhys. “Preach it brotha,” he said, receiving a friendly fist-bump in response. “Orville Omar. Nice to meetcha, intern. I’m working on interface design.”

A blue-furred goat snapped up a snack bar and opened it, offering it to Nina. “Trixie Taylor,” she said, her voice sounding almost like a stereotypical surfer girl. Nina tried to take the bar and wrapper. “Hey, just the bar,” Trixie said. When Nina obliged and took just the bar, Trixie started to chew on the foil wrapper. “I’m working on the story. Our project is a visual novel.”

A gray-scaled alligator stood up off a padded bench and looked over Nina, then the board game. He pulled a tile out of a bowl and laid it down. “Gavin Graham,” he said. “I’m doing backend features… and code optimization.”

“Oh, that sounds impressive. My code is always like fettucine,” Nina said, working out a little bit of a laugh.

Gavin let out a chuckle. “I do love me some pasta code,” he said, holding a hand up. “Good pun.”

Nina smiled awkwardly and raised her hand to give Gavin a high-five. “I feel like I just walked into a comic with all these alliterative names,” she said. “But I guess Nina Nuñez fits right in, huh?”

“Sure,” said a new voice, standing behind her and Amanda. “Manda, how’s your background art coming?”

“We’ve got months before we need all of that,” Amanda said, sighing. “Emma Estrada, say hello to our new intern.” Amanda helped turn Nina around to see the fox-girl behind them.

Emma had silver fur with bright blue highlights around her face and ears. “¿Es así, Manda? Hóla novata. Soy Esmeralda, pero todos me llaman Emma.”

Nina nodded. “Te entiendo, y espero que estés bien si te llamo Emma.” She spoke fluently, even though she mostly only spoke Spanish around her extended family.

Amanda sighed. “Great, two latinas. I’m sure you’ll be besties in no time.”

Emma nodded and smirked. “Nice to have someone I can gossip with privately, then. I’m the lead for all the art on our project. Manda is doing backgrounds so I can focus on characters.”

A moment later, the elevator chimed and as the doors opened, a sturdy pig-man stepped out. “What are you all staring at,” he said loudly, looking over the group. “Nessa wants to stop by before we wrap up tonight, so please tell me you’ve all made some progress. I don’t want this game canned because we’re not able to show anything new.”

“Hey Lar,” Amanda said, waving. “I guess lunch didn’t go well? But we have our new intern visiting.”

“One of the two who starts on Monday, you mean?” Lar looked over Nina. His expression softened and he held out a hand for her. “Fine, as long as you’re all getting stuff done, she can hang out. But don’t work her today. Sound fair, kid?”

Nina nodded and shook his hand. “If it’s really okay with you.”
