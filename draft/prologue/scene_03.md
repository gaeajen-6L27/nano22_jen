Nina still had a few days before school started back up. She had planned the semester around afternoons at her internship, and mornings on campus if she had any classes — which was only Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. She wanted to get used to the travel between campus and the office, so she was using this Thursday, before school, to try out the route from school to the office. It was 15 minutes on the local rail, and then a five minute walk. It might be a bit tight if the train was busy, but it was more convenient than the old buses had been when she was in high school.

She came into the front lobby of the studio and saw a badger-girl who smiled and waved to her. There was a man at the front desk, and he waved her over. “Good afternoon, miss. Do you have an appointment?”

“Oh, uh,” Nina swallowed as she looked at him. He was cute, a fox with coppery fur and eyes a warm brown like cooling embers. “I, er, I’m one of the new interns,” she stammered out. “I know I don’t start until Monday, I just…”

The badger-girl had turned around and moved to the reception desk quickly. “Wait, you’re Nina Nuñez, right? I can bring you to meet the team if you’re ready, Miss Nuñez.”

“I, well, I mean, if that’s okay?”

“Amanda,” the badger said, holding out her right hand. “I’m Amanda Andrews, and I’m one of the leads for the team you’ll be working with. I’m sure Larry will be happy to get you introduced before your first day.”

Nina could feel herself blushing as she took Amanda’s hand. “Th-thank you, Miss Andrews. I think I’d like that.”

The fox nodded and returned to focusing on a laptop on his desk. “I’ll let the bosses know you’re showing her around,” he said idly before Amanda started to lead Nina into the offices.
