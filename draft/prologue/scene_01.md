Nina took a deep breath as she held the envelope in her hands. She’d been struggling with her desire to work at FUBUKI and her conscience over the allegations coming out against them. This year was the last straw — she couldn’t intern for a company that treated female employees like that, and so she’d looked closer to campus.

She picked up an old dull butter knife that she used for opening her mail, and worked it into the flap of the envelope. She was as meticulous about opening her mail as everything else, and she focused entirely on the process of sliding the knife along the crease, opening the envlope and lot on anything she might see inside it. That was for after it was open.

As the knife slipped through the last bit of the crease, she closed her eyes and made a little prayer. She wanted to do art, not a systems internship, but she couldn’t graduate without completing an internship. She wanted to graduate with her classmates, and that meant she had to take what she could get, but she still _wanted_ to get an internship with an art department.

She took out the letter, then opened her eyes as she unfolded it. Teh letterhead was a good sign: Redwood Game Studio.

“Miss Nuñez:

We have reviewed your portfolio and internship application, and communicated with your school’s internship office. Thank you so much for your interest in the position. As you know, we are hard at work on several projects, and seeking student interns to help us out: you may also know we have three open positions for interns over the next few months.

“Your application and portfolio speak to your talent and skill, and we look forward to seeing you on the afternoon of December 16th for a final internship interview.”

Nina let out a breath she’d barely realized she was holding. Courses ended this week. Tomorrow was her final exam for her marketing class. The sixteenth was next week. She’d have to let mama and papi know she’d be in Alabaster until the interview, visiting them late for the holidays. She’d need to make sure her professional clothes were clean for the interview.

This was it. She’d land the internship, graduate in May, and then get the job she’d always wanted!
