## Physical Description

Nina is an otter girl who stands about 5’6” or 168 cm tall, and has a slightly pear-shaped body. Her base fur color is lilac, with white rings aroudn her muzzle, eyes, wrists, and ankles, and solid white fur on her tummy below her breasts, and the underside of her tail. She dresses in a conservative and professional manner which conceals her 32C breasts as much as possible, and prefers one-piece swimsuits to bikinis of any sort.

## Personality

Nina is a diligent and conservative young woman, though she is beginning to question her conservative values after her internship at FUBUKI Gaming’s US division. Nina is a deeply repressed EFTJ personality type, typically convinced (without much reflection) that her ingrained beliefs are inherently more right than those of other people — even if they are the same belief.

### Habits/Mannerisms

+ Smiles awkwardly when her values are challenged in a positive way
+ Tends to tell other people what they think, believe, or feel
+ Drools when she finds something sensual or sexually appealing

## Background

Raised in a Catholic household, Nina considers herself a polytheistic Catholic — she’s not convinced that the Godhead is the only divine being in the universe, but is comfortable with Catholic teachings being those of the ultimate and highest god. She has repressed her sexuality due to her acceptance of Catholic teachings, and rarely reflects on herself without the assistance of a priest or other religious figure to help keep her from straying.

Despite being Extroverted, Nina has found herself not socializing with many of her university peers due to their various defiances of what she believes to be true — fornication, abnormal gender roles, homosexuality, etc. She has reconciled this by spending attending a conservative Bible Study throughout her ears, and has been drawn through this group into an even more extreme position than she originally held.

It has only been during her internship that Nina has stepped outside of her comfort zone and started to socialize with the queer, neurodiverse, and progressive liberal people around her regularly, and begun to see that they are not demonic or hateful. This dissonance has finally caused her to start questioning her own personal identity, which prompts her to accept Amanda’s invitation to the New You Resort.

## Conflicts

### Internal Conflicts

Growing up Catholic, Nina believes herself to be a woman before all else, subject to God’s teachings for how a good woman should act. She believes she is straight and looking for the right man, and that she wants (and will leave the workforce for) children.

Internally, she has repressed her attraction to women and any genders other than men, and she has a deeply unsatisfied dominant streak. She has no desire for marriage or children, except for the expectation that she seek both out as a godly woman.

### External Conflicts

Nina faces conflicts to her world-view and religious beliefs every time she steps outside of her comfort zone, but the biggest external conflicts she faces are:

+ **Loss of Community:** Nina knows the community she values from the church and her bible study will abandon her if she strays too far from the righteous path of the Bible. Some of her bible study members have already started shaming her for spending time with sinners…
+ **Amanda’s Crush:** Nina knows that Amanda is single, attracted to women, and has a crush on her. Nina doesn’t want to hurt Amanda, but her convictions repeatedly cause her to freeze up and do nothing to accept or reject Amanda’s feelings when the opportunity does present itself. She also knows most of her new work friends are aware of this.

## Notes

+ Nina starts the story struggling against her own attraction to other women.
