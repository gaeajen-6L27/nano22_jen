+ Tends to get very close to people without much thought for their boundaries
+ Tends to leap before looking, literally and figuratively.

## Background

Amanda grew up in a liberal progressive household with no religious inclinations, but her parents were still strict disciplinarians, expecting her to dress properly and to keep high marks in school to have any free time outside of her work. She learned how to turn all of her play into projects her parents would approve of at a young age.

Amanda threw herself deep into reinventing herself after she entered university on a scholarship, and used a friend’s invitation to the New You Resort for Sophomore Spring Break to really cement the changes she wanted. She plans a trip there at least once a year so she can iron out any difficulties, or make new changes she wants.
